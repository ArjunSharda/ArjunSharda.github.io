# How TimeConv was made

TimeConv was made with Bootstrap 5, vanilla JS (Date module), and vanilla CSS. The primary intention at first was to make a website based on UTC conversion of UTC seconds to datetime [which is still on the website](https://arjunsharda.github.io/TimeConv/utcsecondstodatetime.html), however, it was then renamed to TimeConv to serve extended purposes than just one topic.
