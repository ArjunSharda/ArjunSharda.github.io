# TimeConv: Security

In a case of a security vulnerability that you have found, please report this confidentially to Arjun Sharda via email (sharda.aj17@gmail.com) and notify him about it. Make sure to not share it with anyone and do not create a pull request/issue as a fix to it unless said so.

### Security vulnerabilities of the latest version should ONLY should be reported. Outdated versions should not be reported as they are no longer used anymore, unless the vulnerability is still in the latest version.
